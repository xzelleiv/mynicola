Hello my Nicola

I made this for you:p

First of all, I want to thank you for all the things you've done, and i'll cite them here.

You altered 99% of my decisions as soon as I met you, I consider how you would feel about everything to the point that you unconsciously alter the way I decide, and 100% of those decisions worked.
You make me Pray. No need for an explanation:p
You made me confident about who I am and how i am, You made me do my best right about everything.
You corrected the mistakes I barely notice
You help me fall asleep when I couldn't
You made me take care of myself mentally, Physically and spiritually:p
You make my day a whole lot better when you're talking to me
You make me feel the love i've never experience before
You made me dedicate all the beautiful things to you
You make me remember you whenever a love song plays
You make me remember you whenever I see a poet about love
You forgave me
You believed me
You trusted me
You never judge me:p

and cons: YOU MAKE ME WORRY😡
Every beautiful things remind me of you:p

Thank you Nicola, You've done too much kindness to me i couldnt even list them all, may your life be the longest as for you to take care of our future kids:p

You don't know how much I love you, there's no such word to explain my love for you, it is ineffable. You make me smile while taking rice from the pot ekoi😒
Never in my life have i been introduced to a parent, I was always loved(?) but was never introduced. And you changed that, I could literally chitchat with your grandmother, and I would proceed to talk about how beautiful you are, Nicola.

Thank you, My forever, My soulmate, and My future wife<3
Palagi kang kumain nang ayos ha? uminom ng water and mag pahinga:p Mahal na mahal kita

THANK YOU, again & again, now word can express how thankful I am for you. thank you for accepting me, for trusting and believing me, ekoi

Hays Nicola, we've known eachother for such a short time pero grabeng effort na pinapakita natin sa isa't isa, I hope na we stay this way forever, sobrang dami mo nang nabago sa 'kin, at nag bago ka din para sa 'kin, napapansin at naappreciate ko lahat nang yon Ekoi, sana alam mo, eheheh.

Mahal na mahal po kita, malapit na birthday mo, and excited na 'ko, kasi yun yung araw na pinanganak yung pinaka mamahal ko, magiging asawa at Ina ng mga anak ko:p — I may not be as well and good as you when it comes to writings Ekoi, pero I try my best to express myself, and how I feel for you this way, sana naiintidihan mo Ekoi ko.

I hope you know na genuine yung mga intentions ko saiyo, and I am here to marry you, as I said, suitor is someone who's courting a girl with an intention to marry hehe, I love you now, and I promise to love you forever—I hope the time comes where we would here "You look so beautiful in white" on Lord's Table, the churches corridors and I hope to dance you, even if hindi ako pala-sayaw, papraktisin ko yun in advance para lang saiyo ekoi, gusto mo ngayon na e🙄🥰

to end this addition, //Pinky promise:p

Happy happy birthday to my love. the one I would marry, the one that I would walk to the churches' corridors, I thank God, your mom, and your dad for birthing you, and for your mom for raising you as who you are right now. 
You are the best person I've ever met, it felt like you were the puzzle missing in my life, and meeting you completed who I was, thank you dahil ikaw ang kakampi ko sa lahat, na kahit lahat against sa 'kin you stayed by my side.
Do not treat your birthday like a normal day Ekoi, kasi it is one of the most important day for me, my soulmate, my wife, and the other half of me is born.
It seems so crazy and unreal and ina-accept mo parin ako kahit sobrang dami nang nagawa ko noon, salamat talaga ekoi, and lalo na yung you ended the call to ask me soemthing hiyang hiya ako kasi we both know i'm lying😓😓
You don't know how much I appreciate you 
Ekoi, just like how ineffable my love is for you, and that's why I'm trying to express it through actions, I hope na nakikita mo Ekoi, kung gaano kita ka-mahal, I would do the impossible—I would die for you, my love.

I love how clearly n vividly visualize you in my dreams, as if kilalang kilala ka na ng utak ko, and your roles were always the same, the mother to my kids, and my cute wife:p

May your wishes come true, may you live a happy life, my wish is the same, sana ikaw na mapang-asawa ko, it is a long shot, masiyado pa tayong bata, pero wala namang masama mangarap hehe, once again ekoii, Happy happy happpyyyy birthday my one and only.

It's been 10 days since I did my first addition ekoi, and they things I would say is still the same, if not improved; you're still the best girl ever, the most gorgeous girl and the most mesmerizing one, this is once again a thank you addition for how well you treat me Ekoi.

First one. Ekoi, salamat sa pag intindi sa 'kin, sa pag validate ng nararamdaman ko especially pag nag seselos or pag may problema tayo, salamat sa unti-unti mong pag babago tsaka pag pupursigi para maintindihan at para maging komportable ako sa mga kilos mo, salamat dahil hinding hindi mo ko hinahayaang mag-palipas ng oras o matulog nang hindi mo nalalaman at nasosolusyonan kung ano man yung nararamdaman ko, ini-intindi mo 'ko nang sobra, and sobra ko ring naa-appreciate yun kasi I've never been understood this much.

Second. Sorry Ekoi, sorry for being like this, I know na you'd tell me to stop apologizing pero Ekoi, you can't admit na minsan sobra na ako, pasensiya na po kung ganon palagi nararamdaman ko, kahit na alam kong ganon ka lang talaga nasasaktan padin ako, sorry din dahil kung ano ano pinapagawa ko saiyo, I promise you can say no.

Baby, Thank you so much for being who you are. You really are flawless, baby ko—nakikita ko lahat ng ginagawa mo para sa'kin, at I appreciate everything you do to try and not make me uncomfy, and I can tell you that it works baby. 

Your words calms me down, comforts me—and it has never been done before, I've never got my peace of mind before. And now you're here, I'm so glad that naiibabalik mo yung pag mamahal ko, at yung binabalik mo sobra sobra.

HELLOOO MY EKOIII, I would just go and paste my additions into here but i wanna make a fresh one😝 ever since the last message i sent you dun sa addition, none of things i said has changed lovee YOU'RE STILL THE BEST, PRETTIEST, AND THE KINDEST GIRL I'VE EVER KNOWN, you're the ray of sunshine that fixed every broken pieces of me, and it's as if you're the missing one.

life's so much better when you came, no. life became better when you came, and I couldn't ask for more baby. 
you've done so much things for me baby, you comfort me, you calm me down without me asking for it. 

you're like a blanket t hat coats me with
your warmth and love baby:3 
your eyes, and your smile's like a light that lights up my world, a light that taking out the shadows—the bad things out my life, my pasts, Ekoi fills all the missing void in me which I appreciate very much😞😞 I hope you feel the same lvoe.

Your efforts knows no bounds, kahit pareho tayong antok na antok na; you take your time to explain, comfort, assure and calm me down to something I'm uncomfy about. your personality, and heart is as beautiful and gorgeous as your face and smile baby. lahat naman saiyo maganda baby, pero on a deeper level, your persona, how you love and treat me, your actions and the way you're so willing to change for me; how you reciprocate and reflect my actions baby, it truly amazes me, kasi no ones ever done that for me before, you never let your pride get you love. which I adore you for, so much.

you love and treat me so perfectly Ekoi, you're my bestfriend, my chika partner, and my biggest supporter:p you're the one who believes in me when I don't believe myself, lalo na nung unang bes natin nag usap baby, kahit against na lahat sa 'kin e nandito ka parin, you stayed, you gave me your chances and you loved me like no one else ever did. naiiyak ako sa tuwing na-aalala ko na pinag tutulungan na 'kong siraan, maski ako nag self sabotage na, pinapalayo kita para hindi ka madamay, but you stayed, baby.

With you by myside, everything feels do-able, and I feel invincible; parang kahit sino papalagan ko to defend you lang, kahit sino idedebate ko, madefend ka lang.

I'm thankful to have you love. I will marry you. I pinky promise.

sincerely, your future husband:p
